# Stacks

Stacks are like a stack of plates. Its 'Last In, First out', which means that the item that was placed on the stack most
recently, is the first item out.

Stacks have 2 main methods:

1. **push()**: adds an item
2. **pop()**: removes and returns the top item

They can include some utility methods:

1. **peek()**: returns the item on the top of the stack without removing it
2. **is_empty()**: returns True if the stack is empty, False otherwise
